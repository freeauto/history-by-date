# history-by-day
A Chrome extension that lets you browse your history by day, instead of infinite scroll.

# Why?

I obsessively track every minute of my time. And I often refer to my Chrome browser history to get a sense of what I was doing at certain times on certain days. If you've ever tried doing that, you'll find that it is a very broken experience -- a laborious infinite scroll, and often the scroll resets randomly.
